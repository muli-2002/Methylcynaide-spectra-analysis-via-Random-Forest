# Methylcynaide-spectra-analysis-via-Random-Forest
This project investigates the application of a supervised machine learning algorithm, the Random Forest classifier, for estimating key physical parameters—temperature (K), column density (cm−2), and source size (arcseconds)—of protostars based on methyl cyanide emission spectra.
